Biography
Early Life
Berengar was brought to Kaer Morhen and trained to become a witcher. However, for the rest of his life, he harbored resentment toward the witchers, blaming them for subjecting him to the mutations and depriving him of the chance to live a normal life. During his time at Kaer Morhen, Berengar became acquainted with fellow witchers such as Geralt of Rivia. He also learned about the legend of Raven's armor.
While at Kaer Morhen, Berengar attempted to forge the sword Tor'haerne. After repeated failures, he sought Vesemir's help, though he quickly came to regret it due to Vesemir's relentless words of wisdom, which greatly annoyed him. On one occasion, Berengar ventured into the valley to hunt a chort, taking all his equipment with him. The hunt was unsuccessful, and he lost the diagram for the sword. Shortly after this failed hunt, Berengar left Kaer Morhen, never to return.
Life on the Path
For years, Berengar traveled across the Northern Realms, taking on witcher contracts and searching for Raven's armor. However, he found it difficult to connect with people, struggling greatly with their disdain and mistrust toward witchers.
One day, he accepted a contract in the Outskirts of Vizima, where the locals were being terrorized by a Hellhound. Determined to complete the task, Berengar sought information from the villagers, including the Witch Abigail, and carefully tracked the monster. Before he could confront it, however, he was captured by Salamandra bandits. Under duress, Berengar disclosed the location of Kaer Morhen and was coerced into assisting Salamandra with their experiments on mutations. Eventually, he managed to escape from their clutches.
After his escape, Berengar was approached by the alchemist Kalkstein, who needed a witcher to open the tower in the Viziman Swamp. Berengar accepted the contract and traveled to the swamp, seeking information from the locals about the tower. While at the Brickmakers' quarry, he was ambushed once again by Salamandra.
This time, they were far less lenient. Azar Javed confronted Berengar, giving him a grim ultimatum: find and deliver the boy Alvin or suffer dire consequences. Fearful of Azar's wrath and left with no other choice, Berengar reluctantly accepted the task. Following Alvin's trail, he eventually arrived in the village of Murky Waters.
Encounter With Geralt
While in the village, the locals asked Berengar to resolve the conflict between the Vodyanoy and the villagers. However, he showed little interest in the contract. During his search for Raven's armor in a nearby crypt, Berengar was approached by Geralt, who had been tracking him for some time.
The two witchers spoke, during which Berengar made no effort to hide his disdain for Geralt and witchers in general. He mentioned the Vodyanoy contract, adding in a mocking tone that such a task would "suit his legacy."
Later, after Geralt defeated Dagon at the behest of the Lady of the Lake, Berengar confronted him again. This time, he confessed the truth about his involvement with Salamandra.
If Geralt spares Berengar: Geralt, reasoning that he was neither a judge nor an executioner, decided to spare Berengar and did not engage him in a fight to the death. Berengar, surprised by Geralt's mercy, handed him a letter explaining his actions before setting off to redeem himself by confronting Azar Javed.
Berengar arrived at Azar's secret base just as Geralt confronted the renegade mage. The two witchers joined forces to battle the sorcerer, ultimately managing to kill him, though Berengar lost his life in the process.
If Geralt fights Berengar: Angered by Berengar's betrayal, Geralt engaged his fellow witcher in battle and ultimately killed him. Geralt then took Berengar's medallion as a token of the slain witcher.
The Witcher
After a long search through the swamp, Geralt finds a cloven Salamandra medallion, along with Berengar's belongings leading him to conclude that Berengar must be dead. However, in Chapter IV, Geralt finds Berengar, still very much alive just outside of Murky Waters.
Berengar and Geralt work together briefly, before Berengar explains why he left Kaer Morhen. He voices his disdain for the Witchers, whom he holds responsible for denying him a normal life. Later, on Black Tern Island, Berengar confronts Geralt with the intention of challenging him to a duel, forcing Geralt to choose once again, his next course of action.
If he spares Berengar, then Geralt will have an ally to aid in the final battle with Azar Javed. If he duels with Berengar (as Geralt tells Berengar, just before the fight), only one can come out alive and Geralt prevails. This leaves Geralt with Berengar's remaining belongings, which include a powerful medallion, so powerful in fact, that Azar Javed cannot fail to notice it in the final battle.
Note that when Azar Javed kills Berengar (if Geralt spared him earlier), the powerful medallion cannot be found on his corpse.
Journal entry
Vesemir mentioned a witcher who had left Kaer Morhen before my arrival. His name is Berengar.
Berengar was seen in the Outskirts earlier. He agreed to kill the Beast but then disappeared. Did he fear facing the monster?
I found out Berengar had dealings with Salamandra. I don't know whether he was their associate or enemy.
Berengar remains one step ahead of me. He was in Vizima, where he was hired by Kalkstein the alchemist. Just like me.
Berengar the witcher is dead.
The early rumors about Berengar proved false. The witcher was working with Salamandra, and the Professor had ordered him to find Alvin.
I finally met Berengar in the village of Murky Waters. A bitter and unfriendly outcast, he bears a grudge against other witchers. Apparently, I'm included.
I had a serious conversation with Berengar, which left me with a better understanding of his experiences and motivations. Berengar seemed moved and decided to seek peace elsewhere, far away from trouble.
Berengar wrote a letter in which he admitted that he was a coward, that he had collaborated with Salamandra and that he had betrayed Kaer Morhen. I was moved by our meeting - Berengar set off to Vizima to catch Azar Javed in a hidden Salamandra laboratory.
If Geralt spares Berengar:
This time it was Berengar who followed me. He came to my aid as I fought Azar Javed. Unfortunately, he perished, but his sacrifice was not in vain.
If Geralt kills Berengar:
After a tense conversation, Berengar challenged me to a duel. I had to kill him.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
Although deceased, Berengar is indirectly involved in the Kaer Morhen quest Berengar's Blade. The quest cannot be triggered if Geralt already has the silver blade Tor'haerne in his possession. Also, while doing the Contract: Doors Slamming Shut, Geralt can tell his contract giver which school he belongs to. When answering he belongs to the school of the Wolf, Count Kurt Dysart will tell him he once knew a witcher from the school of the wolf, his name beginning with the letter B, possible referring to Berengar.
Notes
It is actually possible to prevent Azar Javed from killing Berengar at the end of Chapter V, but nothing happens between Geralt and Berengar if this is the case. When the player clicks on Berengar, the witcher says: "I needed time to think" as a normal NPC would do, no choice dialogues appear. If Geralt returns to the Laboratory in the catacombs of the Old Mansion, Berengar is still standing there as if the game never expected the player to prevent Berengar's death.
