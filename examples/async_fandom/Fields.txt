Fields
In the fields surrounding the village, golden stalks of grain proudly sway in the wind, while the picturesque ruins of an old mill and a small hermit's hut give the place a fairy tale feel. Recently, this idyllic scene was disrupted by the appearance of noonwraiths, nightwraiths, renegade vodyanoi and devourers.
It is astounding how much ancient magic is left in this land. Here stands the Druids' circle, with which the Sages can measure time and, according to some, predict the future.
