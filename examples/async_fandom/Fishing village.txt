Fishing village
The homes in the Outskirts of Vizima are divided into a few small clusters of huts. One of these areas is the fishing village. There are five huts in the fishing village, the most prominent being Haren Brogg's house. The fishing village is just east of the main village, across the river from the old mill, on the road to the Merchants' bridge.
