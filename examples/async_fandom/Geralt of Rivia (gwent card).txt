Notes
Along with Ciri this card has the highest Strength points a single card can give when played without any special effects or risks attached.
If you are first to play during the first round and play one of these two cards on your first move there is a good chance your opponent will immediately pass the first round.
You can take advantage of this by playing the Scoia'tael deck which allows you to choose who plays first.
As of Patch 4.0 there are two versions of this card, one with Muster and another without. Which one you get depends on whether you have the Roach card unlocked or not.
Note that if the Roach card was not redeemed before December 31, 2023, there is not a way to obtain it afterwards from My Rewards. While one can use console commands, it will not appear redeemed on the account itself.
