Notes
The teleportation crystal which Kalkstein gives Geralt in Chapter II is also labelled as a gem, but it can neither be bought nor sold as it is a quest item.
The swordsmith off the Trade Quarter marketplace will require a gem before he reforges a sword. There seems to be no benefit from doing this, though.
