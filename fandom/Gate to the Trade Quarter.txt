Gate to the Trade Quarter
Gate from the Trade to the Temple Quarter
The Gate to the Trade Quarter also happens to be the Gate to the Temple Quarter, depending on which side of it you find yourself. Unless you use the teleporters exclusively, you will find yourself going back and forth through these gates quite a few times in the course of Chapters II and III in the game.
