Vizima Confidential
Vizima Confidential is basically the framing quest for Chapter II of The Witcher. It spawns and is fed by several other quests in that chapter of the story.
Walkthrough
In this quest, with the help of the local private investigator Raymond Maarloeve, Geralt will need to indulge himself in a lot of investigative works to hopefully uncover the real identity of the man behind local Salamandra activities, as well as unearthing the truth regarding the possible collaboration with Salamandra for a total of 6 suspects:
Kalkstein, an alchemist Geralt has met before in the Outskirts.
Declan Leuvaarden, a rich merchant from Nilfgaard.
Ramsmeat, the local kingpin of the underworld.
Thaler, a fence who also is the living embodiment of foul language.
Vincent Meis, the captain of the City Guard.
Golan Vivaldi, a dwarven banker.
Early investigations
This quest starts after Geralt decided to visit a local private investigator recommended by Siegfried, Raymond Maarloeve. After all, the witcher just barely regained his freedom in an unfamiliar city, with the only suspect being the head of the local law enforcement. He could definitely use an experienced helping hand.
From the detective Geralt learns that the city guard recently arrested a man wearing Salamander pins, the so-called Crown Witness. Needless to say, an interrogation could prove extremely valuable to the investigation effort. Now the witcher just needs to find out where the city guard is holding the prisoner.
Following the quest The Crown Witness to its completion, the witcher now has two new leads: Ramsmeat and Kalkstein.
Reporting back what he just found out, Geralt follows Raymond's advice and sets out to gain Kalkstein's trust. Geralt can also investigate on Ramsmeat and with proper preparation (having beforhand found the 3 clues) deduce his innocence immediately after the conversation with Raymond. After getting the information from the two books requested by Kalkstein during A Mysterious Tower, Geralt figures that the alchemist must trust him enough now. Time to report back again.
Yet this time the witcher finds Raymond under assault by some of Salamandra's best assassins. Geralt intervenes in a heartbeat and saves the detective's life, who then decides to lay low for a bit in light of the attack. Before leaving, he leaves Geralt with a List of suspects, giving our hero three new people to question: Leuvaarden, Thaler and Vivaldi.
After the necessary questioning is done, a messenger boy approaches Geralt, informing him that Raymond would like the witcher to come for a meeting.
It is at this point that the possibilities of the quest really start to emerge - and things get really interesting, too.
Learning the truth
With Raymond back into the picture, two parallel but not mutually exclusive directions lie ahead of the witcher:
The first: follow the detective's advice like before and attends this meeting, starting the quest Anatomy of a Crime.
The second: Geralt may have realized (after clearing two random suspects) that maybe it's not the best idea to entrust the direction of the entire investigation on Raymond's ability and/or intention alone, and therefore What Lies Beneath has started. Now the chance to start A Gravedigger's Gratitude has come as well.
But regardless of what Geralt chose to do next, what really matters is that on either path the witcher learns critical knowledge that topples the entire investigation so far:
Major Spoiler: The detective coming out of his lay-low period is not the same one as before, but Azar Javed himself!
For simplicity and accuracy, this critical knowledge will be referred to as the "Grand Truth" from this point.
As the de facto objective of this stage of the investigation, it is best to learn the "Grand Truth" only after clearing most of the suspects (all but Kalkstein) in order to not lose xp. Currently there are 3 ways of achieving this:
In the cemetery crypt during the quest A Gravedigger's Gratitude
At the autopsy in the quest Anatomy of a Crime
Cleared 5 of the suspects by any means(Must include Ramsmeat, Thaler, Vincent Meis and Golan Vivaldi)
If Geralt managed to learn the "Grand Truth" by any means, our hero will have to find a way to lure Azar out of his own territory into a trap. This involves the quest What Lies Beneath, where ironically, the witcher finds himself an ally out of the No.1 suspect: Kalkstein. The two agreed to lure Azar to the tower in the swamp for the final confrontation.
If Geralt didn't realized he's been duped until it's too late, which means the autopsy in Anatomy of a Crime ended up misguided and as a result the witcher has killed Ramsmeat, then Geralt will be informed that in order to get to Kalkstein, he will have to lure the alchemist to the tower in the swamp.
Either way, the quest enters its final stage: the opening of the tower.
Opening the tower
With the investigation finished, Geralt must now gain access to the tower in the swamp in order to lure the person he believes to be the culprit behind Salamandra activities around Vizima. This calls for the completion of A Mysterious Tower.
After the tower is open to the world once again, Geralt meets with the detective at the foot of the tower. Depending on whether did he learn the "Grand Truth", the witcher emerges either as the intellectual superior who sees through his opponent's every scheme, or the utter fool who has been duped to the very end.
As the quest comes to an end, Chapter II of the story concludes as well.
Notes
Depending on the choice made in Strangers in the Night, Coleman could be killed as soon as Geralt enters the Hairy Bear Inn after he has spoken to Raymond. His death could proven troublesome in the investigation process, so completes everything exclusive to Coleman before visiting Raymond if you find yourself having to deal with this dilemma. This includes:
Completing Hot Potato side quest.
A clue for Ramsmeat.
A side quest, The Rat, which provides a chance at clearing Vincent Meis of suspicion.
Since there are 3 ways to learn the "Grand Truth", you can afford to miss the chance once or twice. However, Geralt is duped for good if he really killed Ramsmeat.
There is a rare bug that the quest can get stuck if you complete A Gravedigger's Gratitude before attending the meeting with Raymond, the one he sent a messenger boy to inform you about. This does not happen to everyone, but if it does, mod seems to be the only way to progress the quest.
Both the Swamp and Temple Quarter remain accessible in Chapter III, as do most of the characters, so you can still finish some of the quests if you rushed through Chapter II too quickly.
