  "What distinguishes an Alghoul from a regular ghoul in terms of physical characteristics?": "Alghouls, a sub-species of necrophage, are biologically related to ghouls. They are identifiable by their darker color, larger size, and greater strength. The key distinction lies in their intelligence, as alghouls, unlike ghouls and graveirs, can plan and strategize, making them a greater threat. They typically lead ghoul packs, posing a danger to lone travelers, caravans, and farmsteads.",
  "What caused the rapid spread of Alghouls through the Northern Kingdoms?": "The swift proliferation of Alghouls in the Northern Kingdoms resulted from the aftermath of the Northern Wars. The ensuing famine and lack of control attracted these necrophages, leading to their rapid spread.",
  "What makes human flesh irresistible to Alghouls?": "Alghouls develop an insatiable craving for human flesh after years of consuming corpses. This makes human flesh irresistible to them, leading them to prey on the living. They are often found in areas with fresh bodies like cemeteries and battlefields. Alghouls also exhibit greater intelligence than ghouls, capable of planning and leading ghoul packs.",
  "How does an Alghoul's diet evolve over time?": "As a sub-species of necrophage, Alghouls are primarily corpse-eaters. Their diet evolves in response to the availability of corpses in their environment. For instance, their population surged after the Northern Wars, when widespread famine led to an increase in available corpses."
